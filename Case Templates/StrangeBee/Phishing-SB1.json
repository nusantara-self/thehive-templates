Email may not be secure, especially if the user's account was compromised.\n- **Verification**: Confirm the identity of the person you are speaking to before discussing details, to avoid sharing sensitive information with unauthorized individuals.\n\n3. **Information Gathering**:\n- **Document Responses**: Record the answers provided by the victim. Ensure that this documentation is clear and precise for later reference. You can use task logs for this effect.\n- **Assess Impact**: Use the information to assess the immediate impact on the victim and potentially others within the organization. Determine if further actions are needed to secure accounts or systems based on the user’s interactions with the phishing email.\n4. **Provide Guidance**:\n- **Security Advice**: Advise the victim on immediate steps to take, such as changing passwords or monitoring account activity.\n- **Educational Tips**: Provide tips on how to recognize phishing attempts in the future and encourage them to report suspicious activities immediately.\n5. **Follow-Up**:\nSchedule a follow-up if necessary, especially if the victim needs to perform certain actions (like running antivirus scans or changing passwords).\nKeep the communication lines open for them to report any subsequent suspicious activities.",
